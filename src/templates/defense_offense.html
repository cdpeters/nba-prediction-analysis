                Offensive Stats

            <ul>
                <li>
                    This dashboard visualizes the Average Effective Field Goal
                    %, Offensive Rebound %, Turnover %, and Free Throw %. You
                    can view the average for each team and filter the graph
                    season. Currently, we can see the averages of these four
                    metrics for the 2022 season. We chose these metrics for the
                    most relevant offensive statistics because they are most
                    heavily correlated to a successful offense in the NBA.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Effective FG% adjusts field goal percentage to account for
                    the fact that three-point field goals count for three points
                    while field goals only count for two points.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Offensive Rebound % is the percentage of available offensive
                    rebounds a player or team obtains while on the floor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Turnover % is the percentage of plays that end in a player
                    or team's turnover.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Free Throw % is the percentage of free throw attempts that a
                    player or team has made.

                    This dashboard visualizes the Average Blocks, Steals,
                    Defensive Rebound %, and Opponents Points Off Turnovers. You
                    can view the average for each team and filter the graph by

                    Currently, we can see the averages of these four metrics for
                    the 2022 season. We chose these metrics for the most
                    relevant defensive statistics because they are most strongly
                    correlated to a strong defensive team in the NBA.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Blocks occur when an offensive player attempts a shot, and
                    the defense player tips the ball, blocking their chance to
                    score.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Steals are the number of times a defensive player or team
                    takes the ball from a player on offense, causing a turnover.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Defensive Rebound % is the percentage of available defensive
                    rebounds a player or team obtains while on the floor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Opponents Points Off Turnovers is the number of points
                    scored by an opposing player or team following a turnover.

                Offensive vs. Defensive Rating
            </h5>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Offensive rating measures a team's points scored per 100
                    possessions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Defensive rating is the number of points allowed per 100
                    possessions by a team.
                </li>
                <li>
                    From the offensive and defensive ratings, we can calculate
                    the net rating, which measures a team's point differential
                    per 100 possessions. These ratings can help us understand
                    the offensive and defensive efficiency of teams compared to
                    each other. However, these ratings do not determine who the
                    predicted champion will be since there are several other
                    statistical factors we accounted for.
