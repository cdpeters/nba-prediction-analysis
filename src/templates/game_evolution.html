            Game Evolution Visualization
        </h3>
        <p>
            It is important to recognize that the style of the sport has gone
            through many different eras. As the style of the game has changed,
            so too has the style of champion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below is a link to a Tableau visualization that aims to identify
            what seasons constitute the modern era based on data gathered for
            different stat categories. The idea is to narrow the dataset to just
            the years that represent the modern game and to use this data to
            train our machine learning model. The hope is that this will allow
            our model to learn the qualities of a modern NBA champion.

            Analysis
        </h3>
        <p class="pb-2">
            The Evolution of the NBA game has come a long way since 1997 (where
            our data dates back). We have seen a slow and steady change in how
            the style of the game is played.
        </p>
        <div class="pb-2">
            <h5 class="fw-bold">
                3 Point Shots

            <ul>
                <li style="padding-top: 0px;">
                    The first two visuals show an evolution of how teams have
                    evolved from playing a paint-dominant game to players now
                    expected to stretch the floor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Using 3-Point shot statistics such as Attempted, Made, and
                    Percentage we can see the shift and increase in 3-Point
                    shots made in more recent years.
                </li>
                <li>
                    From roughly the 2016 & 2017 season, the style of 3-point
                    shots used shifted dramatically. We can assume that using
                    seasons from 2016 to present in our analysis may show a more
                    accurate presentation of how teams are playing.
