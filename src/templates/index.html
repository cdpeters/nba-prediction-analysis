            Overview
        </h3>
        <p>
            “The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a professional
            basketball league in North America. The league is composed of 30
            teams (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada) and is one of the
            major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada.
            It is the premier men's professional basketball league in the
            world.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Aware of the huge impact this sport has worldwide and the data
            available to us, our final project will focus on learning how
            historical team statistics/data can help us predict the 2022 NBA
            champion using machine learning models. Additionally, we will
            analyze important team statistics to help us come to a consensus
            about why our machine learning predicted certain teams as being the
            most probable choice for NBA Champion.

            Resources
        </h3>
        <p>
            The data for the entire project was web scraped from the following
            official NBA stats page: <a class="link-info"
            href="https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/traditional/?sort=W_PCT&dir=-1"
            target="_blank">Official Team Stats for NBA</a>. We used several of
            their filters to gather different types of stats for both regular
            season and playoff games. The stats gathered were on a "per game"
            basis where applicable.

            Design Map and Entity Relationship Diagrams
        </h3>
        <p>
            The following diagram shows the overall design of our project:
        </p>
        <figure id="fig-infrastructure" class="align-self-center">
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/project_infrastructure.png') }}"
                 class="img-fluid img-border-radius"
                 alt="project infrastructure">
            <figcaption class="pt-2 text-center small">
                Fig 1. Project infrastructure
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            The data is collected via web scraping and loaded into a PostgreSQL
            database. This database feeds into the tableau visualizations,
            machine learning analysis notebook, and the website itself (see the
            table in Fig 4. in the <b>Database Tables</b> section below).
        </p>
        <p>
            In the next two figures we share the entity relationship diagrams
            that represent the design of our database. The first diagram
            contains the tables related to regular season data:
        </p>
        <figure id="fig-erd-season" class="align-self-center">
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/erd_season.png') }}"
                 class="img-fluid img-border-radius"
                 alt="entity relationship diagram for regular season stats">
            <figcaption class="pt-2 text-center small">
                Fig 2. Entity relationship diagram: regular season stats
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Note that the primary key for all of the <i>teams_*</i> tables is
            the combination of season and team name. Additionally, it should be
            noted that the <i>season_records</i> table contains data that was
            common to all of the <i>teams_*</i> tables. We chose to separate
            this data into its own table to reduce redundancy. The same approach
            was applied to the team names and season data which each have their
            own tables.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next diagram contains the tables related to playoff data:
        </p>
        <figure id="fig-erd-playoffs" class="align-self-center">
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/erd_playoffs.png') }}"
                 class="img-fluid img-border-radius"
                 alt="entity relationship diagram for playoff stats">
            <figcaption class="pt-2 text-center small">
                Fig 3. Entity relationship diagram: playoff stats
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            For the most part, the design used for the playoff tables is the
            same as that of the regular season tables. Notice the
            <i>champions</i> and <i>playoff_teams_long</i> tables; we had plans
            for these but did not end up using them. These tables are candidates
            to be cut from the database, reducing redundancy further, since we
            can build them from queries of other tables if needed.

                    We have created a Flask app that will hold our final
                    dashboards and analysis. HTML templates were created and
                    extended from a base template file. Bootstrap CSS and our
                    own CSS file are used for styling. Server side caching was
                    added for the database query in Fig.4 below. Client side
                    caching is allowed for as well.

                    We have included links to our Tableau visuals in our Flask
                    app as well. Originally, we wrote code to embed the visuals
                    directly from Tableau. This ended up being too expensive
                    resource-wise for hosting so we reverted to preview images
                    and links.
