			The Evolution of the NBA game has come a long way since 1997 (where our data dates back). We have seen a slow and steady change in how the style of the game is played. 
		   </p>
		   <ul class="text-white" style="font-family: Aileron"  > 3 Point Shots
				<li> The first two visuals show an evolution of how teams have evolved from playing a paint-dominant game to players now expected to stretch the floor. <br>
					Using 3-Point shot statistics such as Attempted, Made, and Percentage we can see the shift and increase in 3-Point shots made in more recent years. <br>
					From roughly the 2016 & 2017 season, the style of 3-point shots used shifted dramatically. We can assume that using seasons from 2016 to present in our analysis may show a more accurate presentation of how teams are playing. 
				</li>
			</ul>
			<ul class="text-white" style="font-family: Aileron"  > Defensive Stats

				</li>
			</ul>
			<ul class="text-white" style="font-family: Aileron"  > Offensive Stats
				<li> The Offensive Stats visual shows historical trends for average Effective Field Goal%, Free Throw Percentage, Points Off Turnovers, and Offensive Rebounds. <br>
					Effective Field Goal%: Shows a gradual increase in recent years in the average Effective Field Goal% by teams <br>
