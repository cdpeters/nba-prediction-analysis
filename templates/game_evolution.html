		  The Evolution of the NBA game has come a long way since 1997 (where our data dates back). We have seen a slow and steady change in how the style of the game is played.
		</p>
		<h6 class="fw-bold text-white">3 Point Shots</h6>
		<ul class="text-white">
			<li>
        		The first two visuals show an evolution of how teams have evolved from playing a paint-dominant game to players now expected to stretch the floor. <br>
				Using 3-Point shot statistics such as Attempted, Made, and Percentage we can see the shift and increase in 3-Point shots made in more recent years. <br>
				From roughly the 2016 & 2017 season, the style of 3-point shots used shifted dramatically. We can assume that using seasons from 2016 to present in our analysis may show a more accurate presentation of how teams are playing.
